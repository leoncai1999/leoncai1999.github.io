Personal Website

This repository contains the code for a personal website I built out to showcase my background in CS. The
website is coded in HTML/CSS and a minimal amount of Javascript. I used a website template that can be 
found here https://www.themezy.com/demos/151-ceevee-free-responsive-website-template as a point to start
from and customized the template to fit my own needs such as removing the testominals section, adding a 
blog section and embedding my Instagram posts.
