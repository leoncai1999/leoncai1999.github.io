This is my personal website, hosted by GitHub pages. This website showcases an extended resume, discussing
my education background and experience in more detail. Additionally, a few of my projects are showcased
on this site with additional screenshots, details, and App Store/GitHub repository links. My blog posts
from Medium are also embedded in this site.
