This is my personal website, hosted by GitHub pages. This website showcases an extended resume, discussing
my education background and experience in more detail. Additionally, my projects are showcased
on this site with additional screenshots, details, and website/GitHub repository links. My blog posts
from Medium are also embedded in this site.
